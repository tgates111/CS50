    #Speed of execution vs readability of code
    #Use while(true) to do something over and over
    #anything between double quotes is a string in C
    #different levels, source code vs. zeros and ones; compilers convert the inputed source code into machine code to execute the program
    #Early errors in processes have a cascading effect
    #using functiosn to delegate the work
    #There is a finite amount of  memory in RAM, so  can't represent all possible numbers (an infinite amount)
    #   Because of this, you should never compare floating point values for equality
    #more bits equals  more percision in numbers, but there's always a tradeoff
    #Boeing  example of overflow and running out of bits
